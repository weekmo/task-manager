# RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA Marvin Attack vulnerability
# 
# This vulnerability affects the RSA crate used by sqlx-mysql for MySQL authentication.
# However, our application:
# 1. Only uses PostgreSQL (not MySQL) - see Cargo.toml sqlx features
# 2. The vulnerability is specific to MySQL's RSA-based authentication protocol
# 3. SQLx macros require all database drivers at compile time for SQL parsing,
#    but we only use the postgres driver at runtime
# 4. There is no fixed upgrade available for this transitive dependency
# 5. The rsa crate is ONLY used by sqlx-mysql, which we don't use
#
# Risk Assessment: NONE
# - We don't use MySQL or its authentication protocol
# - The vulnerable code path is never executed in our application
# - This is a compile-time dependency only (for macros), not runtime
#
